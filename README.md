# Paint

This is a barebones, minimalistic clone of Microsoft Paint. Only the essentials, with a special focus on creating static images (PNG/JPEG/etc.) and animations (GIF only for now).

Microsoft Paint is a bit frustrating for me. For example, why can't I draw in invisible ink for PNG's? Honestly, that question alone prompted me to make this tool.

Here is my priority list when it comes to building features.



SHOWSTOPPER -- PNG, GIF, Pen, Eraser, Zoom, Pen Size, Color Chooser (INCLUDING INVISIBLE INK FOR PNG AND GIF AT LEAST), Save (image), Open (image)

MUST-HAVE -- Set Dimensions for image, Paint Bucket, Eyedropper tool, Text tool, Rotation, Crop, Flip, Copy/Cut/Paste (whole image), Image metrics, Mouse-hover pixel info (location/color/etc)

SHOULD-HAVE -- Resize Image, Select area, Copy/Cut/Paste (selection), Line/Rectangle/Oval Shape tool, Different Brush types

WANT-TO-HAVE -- Ruler, Grid, More Shapes, More Brush Types

NICE-TO-HAVE -- Thumbnail, Shape Builder, Brush Builder
