# Paint

This is a barebones, minimalistic clone of Microsoft Paint. Only the essentials, with a special focus on creating static images (PNG/JPEG/etc.) and animations (GIF only for now).

Microsoft Paint is a bit frustrating for me. For example, why can't I draw in invisible ink for PNG's? Honestly, that question alone prompted me to make this tool.

Here is my priority list when it comes to building features.



* SHOWSTOPPER -- PNG, GIF, Pen, Eraser, Zoom Options (Minimal), Pen Size, Color Chooser (INCLUDING INVISIBLE INK FOR PNG AND GIF AT LEAST), Save (image), Open (image)

* MUST-HAVE -- Set Dimensions for image, Paint Bucket, Eyedropper tool, Text tool, Rotation, Crop, Flip, Copy/Cut/Paste (whole image), Image metrics, Mouse-hover pixel info (location/color/etc)

* SHOULD-HAVE -- Earlier warnings, Resize Image, Select area, Copy/Cut/Paste (selection), Line/Rectangle/Oval Shape tool, Different Brush types

* WANT-TO-HAVE -- Ruler, Grid, More Shapes, More Brush Types

* NICE-TO-HAVE -- Thumbnail, Shape Builder, Brush Builder

By the way, some notes.

Keyboard controls are active, with expected functionality (space to draw, backspace to erase, etc). NUMPAD is supported too.

Each computer will vary, but I have this application built to handle images of at least 10k by 10k pixels. My program can technically handle more than that, but that is machine dependent.
